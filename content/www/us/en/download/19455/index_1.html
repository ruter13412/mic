SUSPENSION OF CLOUD SERVICES.</p>    <p>      a. Intel may suspend provision of Cloud Services to You, Your affiliates      or any of Your end users without liability, if:    </p>    <p>      i. Intel reasonably believes that the Cloud Services are being used (or      have been or will be used) by You in violation of this Agreement or the      AUP, or any applicable law, court order, rule or regulation in any      jurisdiction, and such use has not been cured by You in the timeframe      provided in the notice;    </p>    <p>      ii. You do not cooperate with Intel’s investigation of any suspected      violation of this Agreement or any applicable law, court order, rule or      regulation in any jurisdiction;    </p>    <p>      iii. Intel reasonably believes that Cloud Services provided to You have      been accessed or manipulated by a third party without Your consent or in      violation of this Agreement;    </p>    <p>      iv. Intel reasonably believes that suspension of the Cloud Services is      necessary to protect Intel’s network or other Intel companies;    </p>    <p>      v.

The continued use of the Software by You may adversely impact the      Cloud Services or the systems or content of Intel or any third party,    </p>    <p>      vii. Intel reasonably believes that the use of the Cloud Services by You      may subject Intel, its affiliates, or any third party to liability; or    </p>    <p>      viii. Suspension is required by law, statute, regulation, rule or court      order.    </p>    <p>      b. Intel will give You reasonable advance notice of a suspension under      this section and You will have fifteen (15) days to cure the grounds on      which the suspension is based, unless Intel determines, in Intel’s      reasonable commercial judgment, that a suspension on shorter or      contemporaneous notice is necessary to protect Intel or its other      companies from operational, security, or other risk or the suspension is      ordered by a court or other judicial body. If Intel suspends Your right to      access or use any portion or all of the Cloud Service:    </p>    <p>      i. You remain responsible for all fees and charges You have incurred      through the date of suspension, if any;    </p>    <p>      ii. You remain responsible for any applicable fees and charges for any      Cloud Services to which You have continued to have access, as well as      applicable fees and charges for data storage, and for in-process tasks      completed after the date of suspension; and    </p>    <p>      iii. At Intel’s sole discretion, Intel may terminate Your access to      Customer Data or delete Customer Data stored in the Cloud Services during      a suspension, and Intel shall not be liable to You for any damages or      losses You may incur as a result of such suspension.    </p>    <p>      c. If the reason for the suspension under Section 7.a above is not cured      in accordance with Section 7.b, then Intel may elect to terminate the      Agreement for breach as described below.    </p>    <p>      8. SECURITY. Intel agrees to maintain commercially reasonable measures      related to physical security of the Cloud Services. You shall be solely      responsible for maintenance, integrity, retention, security, and backup of      the Customer Data. If You transfer or are otherwise involved in the      transfer of any Customer Data (whether in connection with its business or      otherwise) over a public network, then You are solely responsible for      compliance with any applicable laws, rules and regulations in any and all      applicable regions or countries regarding the security, privacy, data      protection, legality and/or safe handling of such Customer Data. Intel      shall not be responsible for any data loss related to Customer Data.    </p>    <p>      9. DEFENSE OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS BY YOU. You hereby agree to indemnify,      defend and hold harmless Intel and its parents, affiliates, licensors and      providers of third party services, and their respective directors,      officers, employees, contractors, agents, successors, and assigns,      (collectively, the “Intel Parties”) (Intel and each of the Intel Parties      an “Indemnified Party”), from and against any and all liability      (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and costs) incurred by the      Indemnified Parties in connection with any actual or alleged claim      (“Claim”) arising out of: (a) Your use of the Software and Cloud Services,      (b) Customer Data; (c) any breach or alleged breach by You of this      Agreement; (d) any breach or alleged breach by You of a third party’s      rights, including, without limitation, any actual or alleged infringement      or misappropriation of a third party’s copyright, trade secret, patent,      trademark, privacy, publication or other proprietary right; (e) any damage      caused by or alleged to have been caused by You or Your end users to the      Cloud Services, Hosted Environment or Software; or (f) any actual or      alleged violation or non-compliance by You or Your end users with any      applicable law, court order, rule or regulation in any jurisdiction. The      counsel which You select for the defense or settlement of a Claim must be      approved in writing in advance by Intel prior to such counsel being      engaged to represent the Indemnified Parties. You shall not in any event      consent to any judgment, settlement, attachment, or lien, or any other act      adverse to the interests of Intel or any Intel Party without the prior      written consent of Intel and/or the applicable Intel Party(s).
